Jupyter notebooks
-----------------

We have set up several Jupyter notebooks so that you can interactively run through code.

The code and output can be seen through this website. To truly run the code and modify it, you can get the source repository `here <https://github.com/Jakidxav/ImpDAR_tutorials>`_. Some of the data source files are a bit large (~100 Mb) to give realistic examples, so this repository is separated from the main code.

.. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 2

        Getting started (notebook) <../ImpDAR_tutorials/getting_started/ImpDAR_GettingStarted.ipynb>
        Variable permittivity (notebook) <../ImpDAR_tutorials/nmo/ImpDAR_NMO_Tutorial.ipynb>
        Migration (notebook) <../ImpDAR_tutorials/migration/ImpDAR_Migration_Tutorial.ipynb>
        ApRES (notebook) <../ImpDAR_tutorials/apres/ImpDAR_ApRES_Tutorial.ipynb>
        Plotting power (notebook) <../ImpDAR_tutorials/plot_power/ImpDAR_plot_power_Tutorial.ipynb>

Additional examples
-------------------
The primary examples that might be useful are those showing the different :doc:`processing <\processing>` steps and the basics of the :doc:`picking gui <\picking>`.

Additional examples are provided showing :doc:`plotting <\plotting>` both via the command line and via the API, and :doc:`loading <\loading>`, though loading in ImpDAR is a single line so the examples are trivial.
