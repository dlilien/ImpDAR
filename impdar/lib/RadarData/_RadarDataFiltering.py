       HFILTDEEP-This StoDeep subroutine processes bandpass filtered
       or NMO data to reduce the horizontal noise in the upper layers.
       The user need not specify any frequencies.  This program simply
       takes the average of all of the traces and subtracts it from the
       bandpassed data.  It will remove most horizontally-oriented
       features in a radar profile: ringing, horizontal reflectors.  It
       will also create artifacts at travel-times corresponding to any
       bright horizontal reflectors included in the average trace.

       You will want to experiment with the creation of the average trace.
       Ideally choose an area where all reflectors are sloped and
       relatively dim so that they average out while the horizontal noise
       is amplified.  Note that generally there is no perfect horizontal

    Original StoDeep Documentation:
        WINAVG_HFILTDEEP - This StoDeep subroutine performs a horizontal filter on
        the data to reduce the ringing in the upper layers. It uses a moving
        window to create an average trace for each individual trace, applies an
        exponential taper to it and then subtracts it from the trace. This is
        based off of the original hfiltdeep and uses the moving window designed
        in cosine_win_hfiltdeep.  The extent of the taper can help to minimize
        artifacts that are often produced near regions of bright bed
        reflectors.

        You will want to experiment with the creation of the average trace.
        Ideally choose an area where all reflectors are sloped and relatively
        dim so that they average out while the horizontal noise is amplified.
        Note that generally there is no perfect horizontal filter that will
